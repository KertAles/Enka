This was my first ever big project and it shows. In 3rd year of high school we had to create a game in Qt Creator and I chose Uno. The end result is quite buggy, but its my first project, so I guess that goes without saying. This project was made in QT Creator



The project is run by opening it in QT Creator and compiling the project(sorry).
